ringsce is an ide for big sur+ (macos 11+). It's being built on top of C++ and swiftUI. We are trying to build all the projects with cmake.
We hope to deliver ringsce to all users, using XCode or appcode. This is not an appcode replacement. It was there a niche. We are here to exploit it.
Today, the ide is still in use. There is so much to do.
